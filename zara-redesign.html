                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">Background</h3>
                <p>E-commerce is the process of buying and selling goods and services over the
                internet. These transactions can be either directly from the business to the consumer (B2C), or business to business
                (B2B). From buying new outfits, to browsing for trainers — there is no denying that the industry has integrated itself
                into almost all aspects of our day to day lives, especially in terms the items we purchase to wear.
                </p>
                <p>Fashion is currently the largest business to consumer segment in the market, with its global size estimated to be at
                around $752.5 billion in 2020 alone. According to a Fashion eCommerce report in 2021, the market is expected to grow
                even more “at 9.1% per year and reach a total market size of $1.64, 7 billion by the end of 2025.”
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">How E-Commerce changed over the past 10 years</h3>
                <p>The e-commerce industry has changed dramatically over the last 10 years, largely in part to continually changing
                consumer habits, and how quickly technology has been evolving. We are now able to make purchases on the move from our
                smartphones with a tap of the finger, shop within social media apps and in some cases, even try out products with
                virtual reality before making a purchase.
                </p>
                <p>BigCommerce spoke with leaders in the industry about some of the changes we have been seeing, and compiled a list of
                trends that could be leading the way in the very near future. The top trends on the list included onsite personalisation
                — which involves using AI (artificial intelligence) to produce a personalised experience for the user. A great example
                of this is Amazon AI recommendation engines to recommend new products to the user based on their previous recent
                purchases. ​​”By recommending products that might interest individual users, Amazon is able to increase the number of
                transactions per customer, maximise the value of each customer and turn them into repeat buyers. By 2013, Amazon
                recommendations were generating 35% of all sales on the eCommerce giant’s platform.”
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">The shift from online to retail</h3>
                <p>Recent technological advancements have meant that the shift from retail to online was inevitable. The decline in brick
                and mortar stores has been evident in the last decade, but has seen a steep decline in the last year alone, largely due
                to COVID-19. A March 2021 news article reports that more than 17,500 chain store outlets closed in 2020, with COVID
                spurring an “average daily closure of 48 shops, restaurants and other leisure and hospitality venues.”
                </p>
                <p>All ‘non-essential’ stores were forced to remain closed for the better part of a year, which accelerated changes that
                were already in motion on the UK high street. This resulted in a shift to online shopping, meaning that they had to turn
                all of their efforts to online presence and e-commerce in order to still make a profit and reduce losses. Many companies
                and brands invested in improving their online user experiences.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">The Brief</h3>
                <p>In this case study, I will be discussing my project, the objectives, and present the following deliverables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 pages: home page and 2 other pages.</li>
                    <li>Mobile and Desktop compatible screens (Responsive)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alongside this, key insights into each stage of the method I will be using — the Double Diamond Process, and detail my
                user research and design process. I will be looking at the ZARA eCommerce website across desktop and mobile, where I
                will go on to identify pain points that customers are facing, and implement design thinking in order to resolve these
                problems in a way that will meet user needs, but also keeping the business needs and objectives in mind also.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">Why ZARA?</h3>
                <p>ZARA is a popular brand worldwide, especially here in the UK. Over the last year, it has become a go-to brand of mine
                when looking for new items of clothing, but the same user experience problems have persisted when trying to navigate
                throughout the site. It has become a deterrent to myself and many others, driving people to either using the ZARA mobile
                app, shopping in person when possible, or not making purchases from ZARA at all. In having a poor user experience, it is
                possible that the website could have higher bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave
                rather than continuing to view other pages within the same site), and a lower conversion rate (the percentage of users
                that take a desired action, ie. completing a purchase) compared to the websites of their competitors. If so, this could
                be a problem for the business as a whole.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">The problem statement</h3>
                <p>With a focus on website navigation and product browsing, how might we use design thinking to improve the customer
                experience in order to help fulfil user needs, as well as make sure the website is aligned with their core values —
                beauty, clarity, functionality and sustainability?
                </p>
                <p>By highlighting the core value of ‘functionality’ and implementing it into the final design solution, business needs can
                be met.
                </p>
                <p>Looking at ZARA reviews from Trust Pilot (as pictured below), it is clear that navigating the website, and product
                browsing are some of the main issues that customers are having — two key features of the online shopping experience. If
                designed poorly, this can quickly drive customers away, which is why it is essential to focus on having a simple and
                easy to use website.
                </p>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/637/0*P8B2_xH3dVdD_tpf" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/637/0*a2J4Gxn4ccjGT_zw" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Jakob’s law states that users spend most of their time on other websites, therefore users want products to feel and work
                the same as other products they know, as they transfer expectations from one familiar product to another. In the ZARA
                websites’ desire to stand out and adhere to the beauty aspect of their core goals, some practices that build a good user
                experience may have been neglected in favour of aesthetics.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">Competitor Analysis</h3>
                <p>A competitor analysis can shine a light on where a specific product stands out, helps to identify strengths and
                weaknesses, and discover what the reasons behind a competitor’s success may be. By using this research method, I can use
                the insight from the data collected to make informed UX design decisions.
                To begin with, I researched ZARA’s direct and indirect competitors, before deciding to use H&M and Mango as direct
                competitors, and ASOS as an indirect competitor.
                </p>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ZdW-GklU-3RbjKGaXwmOdA.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">Competitor Analysis Findings</h3>
                <p>H&M, Mango and ASOS shared the most in common in terms of navigation, and general website layout. The three companies
                all use a navigation bar, and reserved the hamburger menu layout for their mobile sites. They all incorporated clear and
                engaging CTAs (call to action) to their homepages, and featured the ability to add clothing to favourites or a wish list
                so customers can save items they like to come back to in the future. The ZARA website does not have this feature, but it
                is possible to save items to a wish list on their mobile app — which gives a sense of inconsistency. ZARA as a company
                also has the most negative feedback on Trustpilot, with a rating of 1.5/5 stars out of 6,782 reviews. However it is
                important to note that although there is a lot of negative feedback, some it is directed towards in-store experiences,
                customer service, and issues with deliveries/returns.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">User Research</h3>
                <h4>Research Tools: Google Forms, Invision Freehand, Optimal Workshop</h4>
                <p>Next, I carried out a red route analysis. This is a research method that enables users to define what they consider to
                be of value to critical tasks within the user journey. In doing this, I am able to use real customer data to help guide
                my usability testing, and target essential features within the design.
                </p>
                <p>I compiled a list of features from the ZARA. H&M, Mango and ASOS websites that I felt were the most important to a good
                fashion eCommerce website as well as relevant to this project, before gathering a sample of regular shoppers to rank
                these features by how often they used them.
                <br><br>
                Sample details
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>7 regular online shoppers</li>
                    <li>Age range: 22–53 years old</li>
                    <li>Location: UK</li>
                    <li>Professions: Students, Retail workers, Tech, Healthcare workers</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*3qQBcxzmvtiAUojQ" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>What I discovered from my red route analysis was that the navigation and search bar were used by everyone on a frequent
                basis, which lined up with my own original assumptions. This wish list feature was only used occasionally, but by the
                majority of the sample which suggests that it does improve the user experience in some way.
                <br><br>The main takeaway was that ‘sort products by’, the navigation bar and search bar were the most highly prioritised
                features.
                </p>

                <h3 class="my-5 text-center">Questionnaire</h3>
                <p>
                    The next stage of my user research was to send out a questionnaire which I created with Google forms. Questionnaires can
                    be great for gaining qualitative as well as quantitative insights which can be utilised at various points of design
                    testing, and even before beginning design work. By doing a questionnaire, I was able to collect data that further
                    informed me of the pain points users were struggling with, and their experiences with other online clothing stores. In
                    order to get the most accurate data I could, I was careful to ensure to not make any assumptions, and that my questions
                    were not biased in any way.
                </p>
                <h4>Questions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the first thing you do when landing an online clothes store’s website?</li>
                    <li>If you selected other, could you explain a little further?</li>
                    <li>Think to the last time you shopped for clothes online. What was the name of the store, and did you have a good
                    experience?</li>
                    <li>If you had a negative experience, could you explain why in a short sentence?</li>
                    <li>When browsing products, what are the most important factors for you? Select 1–3 options.</li>
                    <li>Do you often shop on the ZARA website?</li>
                    <li>If you answered yes, is there anything that frustrates you when shopping on the ZARA website?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything that could be added to the ZARA homepage to improve your shopping experience?</li>
                    <li>If there’s anything you could change to improve the ZARA website, what would it be?</li>
